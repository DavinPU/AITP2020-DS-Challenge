## Parsing Data

# Focused on variables: HT, HTCD, ACTUALHT, SPCD, DIA, INVYR

~ 1-2 million data points

Findings from examining this subset:
- some heights were negative
- all heights that were negative resulted in a HTCD of 4 (model could be incorrect?)
- some trees measured > 400 ft (tallest known tree is 380ft).
- some diameters measured over 30 ft (biggest known tree no larger than 28 ft).
- na values were deemed unimportant and removed for our next analysis

Graph/analysis focus:
- top 10 trees by height
- does remeasuring the same tree matter?
- height vs diameter
